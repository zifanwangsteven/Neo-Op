### INTRODUCTION
Neo-Op is a gambling device empowered by NEO-N3 blockchain that resembles the payoff of a binary option. In a typical game, players predict whether the price of an underlying asset will be greater than or smaller than a benchmark price point (aka strike price) at a prespecified time (aka expiry). Then, at expiry, the pool owner of the game invokes an automated logic which fetches the price at expiry (aka spot price) and initiates the payout process.
